The trained segmentation model is located at train/weights/best.pt, along with performance-related images inside the train folder. To use the model, create a folder named test_image and place all the images you want to process inside it. You may also adjust the confidence score if needed. The model will automatically generate a folder named output_folder_v11 to store all the results.
